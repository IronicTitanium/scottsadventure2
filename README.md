Scott's Adventure 2
================

Sequel to a game that nobody's heard of. LOL

'Sup. I'm IronicTitanium. You probably haven't heard of it, but a couple years back I created an extremely crappy
2D Platformer called Scott's Adventure. It was really glitchy, and the final boss was extremely OP.

Anyways. I've just started working on a sequel to it, which will (hopefully) be a lot better. I am creating it using the
Unity engine. Later on, I might make an HD version of the original, which will (probably) be better.

I probably won't put up the original, because besides the fact that it's absolute shit, I used some graphics in it that
I'm pretty sure were copyrighted.

Anyways. I will be doing log/update things on March 21, 2013, Day 1.
I might not do anything some days, so I'm sorry. If I don't do something one day, I'll probably either post something
saying why, or I'll skip that day. If I skip a day, I won't skip a day number, I'll just use the next number the next day.
I also plan to (hopefully) add in some sort of screenshot, video, gif, image, or something for each Day involving development.

Development will start in the Early Alpha stages, which will be closed. I will start with version Alpha 0.1.0, which will be closed
and most likely only available for friends and others to test.

Btw. I'm semi-new to coding things and stuff, and also to GitHub. So, please don't be too harsh.
