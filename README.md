Scott's Adventure 2
================

Sequel to a game that nobody's heard of. LOL

'Sup. I'm IronicTitanium. You probably haven't heard of it, but a couple years back I created an extremely crappy
2D Platformer called Scott's Adventure, starring myself. It was really glitchy, and the final boss was extremely OP.

Anyways. I've just started working on a sequel to it, which will (hopefully) be a lot better. I am creating it using the
Unity engine. Later on, I might make an HD version of the original, which will (probably) be better.

I probably won't put up the original, because besides the fact that it's absolute shit, I used some graphics in it that
I'm pretty sure were copyrighted.

Anyways. I will be adding text to this document with each day of development, starting from today, March 21, 2012, Day 1.
I might not do anything some days, so I'm sorry.

Btw. I'm semi-new to coding things and stuff, and also to GitHub. So, please don't be too harsh.
